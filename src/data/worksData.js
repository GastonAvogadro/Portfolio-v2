    description:
      "I worked on the redesign of GoldN’s product pages, which originally contained large blocks of dense information that caused cognitive overload and distracted users from key calls to action. To improve the user experience and drive conversions, I implemented collapsible accordions to organize the information more efficiently. This helped streamline the content hierarchy and guide users more clearly toward secondary sections like reviews and related products. Additionally, the image slider was redesigned to feel more intuitive and mobile-friendly, enhancing product interaction and clarity across devices.",

The most impactful update was the introduction of an image slider within each card, allowing users to preview all dishes included in a menu without needing to navigate to individual product pages. This small UX change significantly improved the browsing experience, resulting in a strong uplift in both conversion rate (CVR) and average order value (AOV). Due to its success, the variant was quickly implemented in the store.",

      "This A/B test addressed a major UX issue: one of the store’s main products—a customizable crossword—added multiple letter variants as separate items in the cart, making it confusing and overwhelming for users. I implemented a logic that grouped all letter variants into a single bundled product, significantly simplifying the cart experience. The test resulted in a notable increase in both conversion rate and average order value, leading to its immediate implementation on the live store.",
